I participated in a Kaggle prediction problem in 2016. The dataset was provided by BNP Paribas and the aim of the competition was to predict whether for a claim, the approval can be accelerated leading to faster payments (safe claim) or whether more details regarding the claim must be taken into account in order to rightly process the claim.

I used several Machine learning algorithms in R and Python to achieve the task.

Final solution included
1. Tuned ExtRa Trees model
2. Tuned XgBoost model
3. Mean stack of these two models
