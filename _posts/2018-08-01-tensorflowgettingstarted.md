Most, if not all Data Scientists, have hit a phase of stagnancy when it comes to writing Data Science Code. We have repetitively trained, tested and inferred thousands of models locally, coding them in R and Python. It is inevitable that at some point or the other, the need for prototyping using scalable technologies will increase. Enter the world of **Spark** and **Tensorflow**, two scalable technologies for creating machine learning models in the era of Big Data.

In this post I would like to summarize the basics of tensorflow in the most simplest and intuitive ways so that you are up and
running with tensorflow in less than an hour.

## Why tensorflow?

1. Because *it is opensource*

2. Because *it is Scalable/Distributed and at the same time runs on Mobiles*

Tensorflow is a suite of software tools most importantly including a Python API which enables data scientists to **create models
in a local Python environment and scale them using the same locally developed code. Cool isn't it?**. Tensorflow can run on
clusters as well as on multiple CPUs/GPUs on the same machine as well as runs on Mobiles which makes it flexible. The scalability
is a result of **tensorflow's programming paradigm in which problems are modelled as graphs** which leads to massively parallel
operations. More on this later.

3. Because *it comes with additional support tools*

'tensorflow' programming language is a part of a 'Suite of Software' which is made available to us.
